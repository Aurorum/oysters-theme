= How do I set up my theme? =

Moana's demo can be replicated in a matter of minutes, all through the Customizer, with just five simple steps:

1. Set your Header Image
2. Visit the "Colors" tab and pick the header and primary colour for your site
3. From "Site Identity", upload your custom logo
4. If you have the Jetpack plugin installed, select "Menus" and add your Social Menu, with links to all your social networks
5. Lastly, head to the Widgets section and add your favourite widgets to trigger your sidebar 

From there, all you need to do is write your first post!

Moana includes support for Jetpack's Infinite Scroll, Social Menus and other benefits it offers, such as Responsive Videos.
