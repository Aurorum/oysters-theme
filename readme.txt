= How do I set up my theme? =

When you first activate your theme, your site may look surprisingly different. Not to worry though! Oysters' demo can be replicated in a matter of minutes, all through the Customizer, with just five simple steps:

1. Set your Header Image to your own gorgeous pick
2. Visit the "Colors" tab and select the header and primary colour for your site
3. From "Site Identity", upload your fancy custom logo
4. If you have the Jetpack plugin installed, select "Menus" and add your Social Menu, with links to all your social networks
5. Lastly, head to the Widgets section and add your favourite widgets to trigger your sidebar 

From there, all you need to do is write your first post!

= There's something which I don't like! =
